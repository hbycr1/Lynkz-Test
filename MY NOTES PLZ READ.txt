Things I would have liked to do:


Frontend:

- Add list of supported shapes to front end UI.


Backend:

- Add XML comments on the controllers, services, models & interfaces to describe the functionality so it is easier understood by other developers.
- Make the natural user language input a lot more flexible and include the ability to comprehend more measurements and possibly utilize somthing like NLQ/NLP instead of regex.
- Improve error handling
- I did not have time to complete the parallelogram shape.
- Use a region to seperate the helper methods
